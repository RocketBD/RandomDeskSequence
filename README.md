# RandomDeskSequence

This light program is used to create a random sequence of an ordered list of objects.  
For example, it's a good idea to create the list of **seat order for students who are going
to take an exam**.

# How to use

**For normal users:**
All you need to is to copy the ordered list (in UTF-8 coded text file (`names.txt`)) into where you save this
program. (Not yet implemented)  
**For developers:**
Copy your file into *src/cn/rocket/randdeskseq/main/names.txt*.
